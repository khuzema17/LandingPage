                <h2>Owlkids Academy</h2>
                <h1>About our Academy</h1>
                <p>The main goal of Owlkids Academy is to overcome the child's fear of speaking a foreign language. We
                    believe that the best solution is to create comfortable conditions for the child to learn, and the
                    condition for the greatest effectiveness of lessons is individual learning, i.e. groups of one.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A child who knows that he will not be assessed by peers present in the class, will find it easier to
                    actively participate in the lesson, and thus learn the material faster. Our teachers are people who
                    are
                    fluent in English and come from English-speaking countries. Each of them is TESOL certified and
                    qualified to work with children.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>None of the teachers came here by accident!</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Our staff places great emphasis on learning through play. Teachers use full-body language to convey
                    emotions and get the child to cooperate. This is known as the Total Physical Response (TPR) method.
                    In
                    addition, our teaching material consists of beautifully designed interactive pictures and cheerful
                    short
                    songs that perfectly complement the teacher's work. Lessons at our school last 25 minutes. This is
                    the
                    optimal time when our youngest students are able to cooperate most effectively with the teacher.
                    However, it should be remembered that in order for learning a foreign language to be effective,
                    lessons
                    should be held at least twice a week. It is very necessary to consolidate already acquired
                    vocabulary
                    and to maintain continuity of speech.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, we believe that children should repeat material at home with their parents using audio
                    and
                    printable teaching materials available in our library.
